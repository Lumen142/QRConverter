# QRConverter

I coded this project to improve myself. I researched the project to make it as simple and straightforward as possible and tried to make everything as neat as possible.

I want to be a back-end developer. I'm not good at front-end development; the front-end was designed entirely by Yapa Zeka, but I researched and learned the back-end myself and coded it.

I hope you like it. :)
